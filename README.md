# anonymousFunction
Anonymous functions, also known as function expressions, are JavaScript functions that do not have a named identifier. Instead, they are defined inline as part of an expression or assigned to a variable. They are often used for shorter, one-time-use functions, or when you need to pass a function as an argument to another function.
In the example above:

    An anonymous function that takes two parameters, x and y, is assigned to the add variable.
    You can then call the function using add(2, 3) to calculate the sum of 2 and 3.

Anonymous functions can also be used directly as arguments to other functions.
